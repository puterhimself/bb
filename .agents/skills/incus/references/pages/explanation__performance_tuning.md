About performance tuning
¶
When you are ready to move your Incus setup to production, you should take some time to optimize the performance of your system.
There are different aspects that impact performance.
The following steps help you to determine the choices and settings that you should tune to improve your Incus setup.
Run benchmarks
¶
Incus provides a benchmarking tool to evaluate the performance of your system.
You can use the tool to initialize or launch a number of containers and measure the time it takes for the system to create the containers.
By running the tool repeatedly with different Incus configurations, system settings or even hardware setups, you can compare the performance and evaluate which is the ideal configuration.
See
How to benchmark performance
for instructions on running the tool.
Monitor instance metrics
¶
Incus collects metrics for all running instances as well as some internal metrics.
These metrics cover the CPU, memory, network, disk and process usage.
They are meant to be consumed by Prometheus, and you can use Grafana to display the metrics as graphs.
See
Provided metrics
for lists of available metrics.
You should regularly monitor the metrics to evaluate the resources that your instances use.
The numbers help you to determine if there are any spikes or bottlenecks, or if usage patterns change and require updates to your configuration.
See
How to monitor metrics
for more information about metrics collection.
Tune server settings
¶
The default kernel settings for most Linux distributions are not optimized for running a large number of containers or virtual machines.
Therefore, you should check and modify the relevant server settings to avoid hitting limits caused by the default settings.
Typical errors that you might see when you encounter those limits are:
Failed

directory
watch:
Too

open

<Error>
<Error>:

See
Server settings for an Incus production setup
for a list of relevant server settings and suggested values.
Tune the network bandwidth
¶
If you have a lot of local activity between instances or between the Incus host and the instances, or if you have a fast internet connection, you should consider increasing the network bandwidth of your Incus setup.
You can do this by increasing the transmit and receive queue lengths.
See
How to increase the network bandwidth
for instructions.

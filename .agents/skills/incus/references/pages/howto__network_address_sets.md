How to use network address sets
¶
Note
Network address sets are working with
ACLs
and work only with
OVN network
or with
bridged networks
using
nftables
only.
Network address sets are a list of either IPv4, IPv6 addresses with or without CIDR suffix. IP ranges (for example
10.0.0.120-10.0.0.130
) are also supported, though a single range may expand to at most 256 addresses. Larger sets of addresses should be expressed using CIDR notation instead. Address sets can be used in source or destination fields of
ACLs
.
Address set properties
¶
Address sets have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
name
string
yes
Name of the network address set
description
string
no
Description of the network address set
addresses
string list
no
Ingress traffic rules
Address set configuration options
¶
The following configuration options are available for all network address sets:
user.*
Free form user key/value storage
Key:
user.*
Type:
string
User keys can be used in search.
Creating an address set
¶
Use the following command to create an address set.
```
incus network address-set create <name> [configuration_options...]

```
This will create an address set without any addresses, after this you can
add addresses
.
Add or remove addresses
¶
Adding addresses is pretty straightforward:
```
incus network address-set add <name> <address1> <address2>

```
There is no restriction about the kind of address you are appending in your set. You can use any mix of IPv4, IPv6, CIDR subnets and IP ranges.
To remove addresses, the same
remove
command can be used instead.
```
incus network address-set remove <name> <address1> <address2>

```
Use of address sets in ACL rules
¶
In order to use an address set in an
ACL
, we need to prepend
name
with
$
(you need to escape the dollar in command line). Then we can refer the address set in
source
or
destination
fields of an ACL rule.

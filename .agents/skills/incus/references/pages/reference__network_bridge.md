Bridge network
¶
As one of the possible network configuration types under Incus, Incus supports creating and managing network bridges.
A network bridge creates a virtual L2 Ethernet switch that instance NICs can connect to, making it possible for them to communicate with each other and the host.
Incus bridges can leverage underlying native Linux bridges and Open vSwitch.
The
bridge
network type allows to create an L2 bridge that connects the instances that use it together into a single network L2 segment.
Bridges created by Incus are managed, which means that in addition to creating the bridge interface itself, Incus also sets up a local
dnsmasq
process to provide DHCP, IPv6 route announcements and DNS services to the network.
By default, it also performs NAT for the bridge.
Note that when NAT is enabled (
ipv4.nat
/
ipv6.nat
), traffic between managed bridge networks on the same server isn’t NATed as it’s routed directly between the bridges, preserving the original source address.
See
How to configure your firewall
for instructions on how to configure your firewall to work with Incus bridge networks.
Note
Static DHCP assignments depend on the client using its MAC address as the DHCP identifier.
This method prevents conflicting leases when copying an instance, and thus makes statically assigned leases work properly.
IPv6 prefix size
¶
If you’re using IPv6 for your bridge network, you should use a prefix size of 64.
Larger subnets (i.e., using a prefix smaller than 64) should work properly too, but they aren’t typically that useful for
SLAAC
.
Smaller subnets are in theory possible (when using stateful DHCPv6 for IPv6 allocation), but they aren’t properly supported by
dnsmasq
and might cause problems.
If you must create a smaller subnet, use static allocation or another standalone router advertisement daemon.
Configuration options
¶
The following configuration key namespaces are currently supported for the
bridge
network type:
bgp
(BGP peer configuration)
bridge
(L2 interface configuration)
dns
(DNS server and resolution configuration)
ipv4
(L3 IPv4 configuration)
ipv6
(L3 IPv6 configuration)
security
(network ACL configuration)
raw
(raw configuration file content)
tunnel
(cross-host tunneling configuration)
user
(free-form key/value for user metadata)
Note
Incus uses the
CIDR notation
where network subnet information is required, for example,
192.0.2.0/24
or
2001:db8::/32
. This does not apply to cases where a single address is required, for example, local/remote addresses of tunnels, NAT addresses or specific addresses to apply to an instance.
The following configuration options are available for the

Note
The
bridge.external_interfaces
option supports an extended format allowing the creation of missing VLAN interfaces.
The extended format is
<interfaceName>/<parentInterfaceName>/<vlanId>
.
When the external interface is added to the list with the extended format, the system will automatically create the interface upon the network’s creation and subsequently delete it when the network is terminated. The system verifies that the
<interfaceName>
does not already exist. If the interface name is in use with a different parent or VLAN ID, or if the creation of the interface is unsuccessful, the system will revert with an error message.

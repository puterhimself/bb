How to add remote servers
¶
Remote servers are a concept in the Incus command-line client.
By default, the command-line client interacts with the local Incus daemon, but you can add other servers or clusters to interact with.
One use case for remote servers is to distribute images that can be used to create instances on local servers.
See
Default image server
for more information.
You can also add a full Incus server as a remote server to your client.
In this case, you can interact with the remote server in the same way as with your local daemon.
For example, you can manage instances or update the server configuration on the remote server.
Authentication
¶
To be able to add an Incus server as a remote server, the server’s API must be exposed, which means that its
core.https_address
server configuration option must be set.
When adding the server, you must then authenticate with it using the chosen method for
Remote API authentication
.
See
How to expose Incus to the network
for more information.
List configured remotes
¶
To see all configured remote servers, enter the following command:
```
incus remote list

```
Remote servers that use the
simple streams format
are pure image servers.
Servers that use the
incus
format are Incus servers, which either serve solely as image servers or might provide some images in addition to serving as regular Incus servers.
See
Image server types
for more information.
Add a remote Incus server
¶
To add an Incus server as a remote, enter the following command:
```
incus remote add <remote_name> <IP|FQDN|URL> [flags]

```
Some authentication methods require specific flags (for example, use
incus
remote
add
<remote_name>
<IP|FQDN|URL>
--auth-type=oidc
for OIDC authentication).
See
Authenticate with the Incus server
and
Remote API authentication
for more information.
For example, enter the following command to add a remote through an IP address:
```
incus remote add my-remote 192.0.2.10

```
You are prompted to confirm the remote server fingerprint and then asked for the token.
Select a default remote
¶
The Incus command-line client is pre-configured with the
local
remote, which is the local Incus daemon.
To select a different remote as the default remote, enter the following command:
```
incus remote switch <remote_name>

```
To see which server is configured as the default remote, enter the following command:
```
incus remote get-default

```
Configure a global remote
¶
You can configure remotes on a global, per-system basis.
These remotes are available for every user of the Incus server for which you add the configuration.
Users can override these system remotes (for example, by running
incus
remote
rename
or
incus
remote
set-urls
), which results in the remote and its associated certificates being copied to the user configuration.
To configure a global remote, create or edit a
config.yml
file that is located in
/etc/incus/
.
Certificates for the remotes must be stored in the
servercerts
directory in the same location (for example,
/etc/incus/servercerts/
).
They must match the remote name (for example,
foo.crt
).
It’s also possible to provide per-remote client certificates by placing them in the
clientcerts
directory.
The similarly must match the remote name (for example,
foo.crt
and
foo.key
).
See the following example configuration:
```
remotes:
  foo:
    addr: https://192.0.2.4:8443
    auth_type: tls
    project: default
    protocol: incus
    public: false
  bar:
    addr: https://192.0.2.5:8443
    auth_type: tls
    project: default
    protocol: incus
    public: false

```
Enabling
keepalive
¶
For those frequently interacting with a particular remote, it’s possible to enable a new
keepalive
mode.
When enabled, Incus will maintain a connection with the target server for up to the configured timeout.
This can significantly reduce the latency when running many
incus
commands.
To enable, use the
incus
remote
set-keepalive
command providing the timeout for the remote.
```
incus remote set-keepalive my-remote 30

```
In this example, a timeout of 30 seconds was used.
Alternatively, you can add the remote with the feature enabled with the flag
--keepalive
.
```
incus remote add my-remote 192.0.2.10 --keepalive 30

```
To disable the
keepalive
, run
incus
remote
set-keepalive
with timeout value 0.
```
incus remote set-keepalive my-remote 0

```

How to set up cluster groups
¶
Cluster members can be assigned to
Cluster groups
.
By default, all cluster members belong to the
default
group.
To create a cluster group, use the
incus
cluster
group
create
command.
For example:
```
incus cluster group create gpu

```
To assign a cluster member to one or more groups, use the
incus
cluster
group
assign
command.
This command removes the specified cluster member from all the cluster groups it currently is a member of and then adds it to the specified group or groups.
For example, to assign
server1
to only the
gpu
group, use the following command:
```
incus cluster group assign server1 gpu

```
To assign
server1
to the
gpu
group and also keep it in the
default
group, use the following command:
```
incus cluster group assign server1 default,gpu

```
To add a cluster member to a specific group without removing it from other groups, use the
incus
cluster
group
add
command.
For example, to add
server1
to the
gpu
group and also keep it in the
default
group, use the following command:
```
incus cluster group add server1 gpu

```
Configuration options
¶
The following configuration options are available for cluster groups:
instances.vm.cpu.ARCHITECTURE.baseline
CPU base architecture name
Key:
instances.vm.cpu.ARCHITECTURE.baseline
Type:
string
The CPU base architecture name as can be found through
qemu
-cpu
?
.
This can be a generic definition like
qemu64
or
kvm64
, or it can be a specific hardware architecture like
EPYC-v2
.
It’s important to ensure that all servers in the group match that baseline.
instances.vm.cpu.ARCHITECTURE.flags
CPU flags to add/remove to/from the baseline
Key:
instances.vm.cpu.ARCHITECTURE.flags
Type:
string
A comma separated list of CPU flags to add on top of CPU baseline or a list of flags to remove from it.
To remove a flag, use
-flag
.
user.*
Free form user key/value storage
Key:
user.*
Type:
string
User keys can be used in search.
Launch an instance on a cluster group member
¶
With cluster groups, you can target an instance to run on one of the members of the cluster group, instead of targeting it to run on a specific member.
Note
scheduler.instance
must be set to either
all
(the default) or
group
to allow instances to be targeted to a cluster group.
See
Automatic placement of instances
for more information.
To launch an instance on a member of a cluster group, follow the instructions in
Launch an instance on a specific cluster member
, but use the group name prefixed with
@
for the
--target
flag.
For example:
```
incus launch images:debian/12 c1 --target=@gpu

```
Use with restricted projects
¶
A project can be configured to only have access to servers that are part of specific cluster groups.
This is done by setting both
restricted=true
and
restricted.cluster.groups
to a comma separated list of group names.
Note
If the cluster group is renamed, the project restrictions will need to be updated for the new group name.

usb
¶
Note
The
usb
device type is supported for both containers and VMs.
It supports hotplugging for both containers and VMs.
USB devices make the specified USB device appear in the instance.
For performance issues, avoid using devices that require high throughput or low latency.
For containers, only
libusb
devices (at
/dev/bus/usb
) are passed to the instance.
This method works for devices that have user-space drivers.
For devices that require dedicated kernel drivers, use a
unix-char
device
or a
unix-hotplug
device
instead.
For virtual machines, the entire USB device is passed through, so any USB device is supported.
When a device is passed to the instance, it vanishes from the host.

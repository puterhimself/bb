How to configure network integrations
¶
Note
Network integrations are currently only available for the
OVN network
.
Network integrations can be used to connect networks on the local Incus
deployment to remote networks hosted on Incus or other platforms.
OVN interconnection
¶
At this time the only type of network integrations supported is OVN
which makes use of OVN interconnection gateways to peer OVN networks
together across multiple deployments.
For this to work one needs a working OVN interconnection setup with:
OVN interconnection
NorthBound
and
SouthBound
databases
Two or more OVN clusters with their availability-zone names set properly (
name
property)
All OVN clusters need to have the
ovn-ic
daemon running
OVN clusters configured to advertise and learn routes from interconnection
At least one server marked as an OVN interconnection gateway
More details can be found in the
upstream documentation
.
Creating a network integration
¶
A network integration can be created with
incus
network
integration
create
.
Integrations are global to the Incus deployment, they are not tied to a network or project.
An example for an OVN integration would be:
```
incus network integration create ovn-region ovn
incus network integration set ovn-region ovn.northbound_connection tcp:[192.0.2.12]:6645,tcp:[192.0.3.13]:6645,tcp:[192.0.3.14]:6645
incus network integration set ovn-region ovn.southbound_connection tcp:[192.0.2.12]:6646,tcp:[192.0.3.13]:6646,tcp:[192.0.3.14]:6646

```
Using a network integration
¶
To make use of a network integration, one needs to peer with it.
This is done through
incus
network
peer
create
, for example:
```
incus network peer create default region ovn-region --type=remote

```
Integration properties
¶
Address sets have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
name
string
yes
Name of the network integration
description
string
no
Description of the network integration
type
string
yes
Type of network integration (currently only
ovn
)
Integration configuration options
¶
The following configuration options are available for all network integrations:
user.*
Free form user key/value storage
Key:
user.*
Type:
string
User keys can be used in search.
OVN configuration options
¶
Those options are specific to the OVN network integrations:
ovn.ca_cert
OVN SSL certificate authority for the inter-connection database
Key:
ovn.ca_cert
Type:
string
Scope:
global
ovn.client_cert
OVN SSL client certificate
Key:
ovn.client_cert
Type:
string
Scope:
global
ovn.client_key
OVN SSL client key
Key:
ovn.client_key
Type:
string
Scope:
global
ovn.northbound_connection
OVN northbound inter-connection connection string
Key:
ovn.northbound_connection
Type:
string
Scope:
global
ovn.southbound_connection
OVN southbound inter-connection connection string
Key:
ovn.southbound_connection
Type:
string
Scope:
global
ovn.transit.pattern
Template for the transit switch name
Key:
ovn.transit.pattern
Type:
string
Default:
ts-incus-{{
integrationName
}}-{{
projectName
}}-{{
networkName
}}
Specify a Pongo2 template string that represents the transit switch name.
This template gets access to the project name (
projectName
),
integration name (
integrationName
), network name (
networkName
)
and peer name (
peerName
).

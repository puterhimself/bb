move
¶
Move instances within or in between servers
Synopsis
¶
Description:
Move instances within or in between servers
Transfer modes (–mode):
- pull: Target server pulls the data from the source server (source must listen on network)
- push: Source server pushes the data to the target server (target must listen on network)
- relay: The CLI connects to both source and server and proxies the data (both source and target must listen on network)
The pull transfer mode is the default as it is compatible with all server versions.
```
incus move [<remote>:]<instance> [<remote>:][<new instance name>] [flags]

```
Examples
¶
```
  incus move [<remote>:]<source instance> [<remote>:][<destination instance>] [--instance-only]
      Move an instance between two hosts, renaming it if destination name differs.

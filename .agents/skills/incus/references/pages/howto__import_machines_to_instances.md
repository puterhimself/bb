How to import physical or virtual machines to Incus instances
¶
Incus provides a tool (
incus-migrate
) to create an Incus instance or volume based on an existing disk or image.
You can run the tool on any Linux machine.
It connects to a local or remote Incus server and creates a blank instance or volume, which you can configure during or after the migration.
The tool then copies the data from the disk or image that you provide.
incus-migrate
can import images in
raw
,
qcow2
,
ova
and
vmdk
file formats. It can also directly download an image from a provided URL.
Note
If you want to configure a new instance during the migration process, set up the entities that you want your instance to use before starting the migration process.
By default, the new instance will use the entities specified in the
default
profile.
You can specify a different profile (or a profile list) to customize the configuration.
See
How to use profiles
for more information.
You can also override
Instance options
, the
storage pool
to be used and the size for the
storage volume
, and the
network
to be used.
Alternatively, you can update the instance configuration after the migration is complete.
When working with instances, the tool can create both containers and virtual machines:
When creating a container, you must provide a disk or partition that contains the root file system for the container.
For example, this could be the
/
root disk of the machine or container where you are running the tool.
When creating a virtual machine, you must provide a bootable disk, partition or image.
This means that just providing a file system is not sufficient, and you cannot create a virtual machine from a container that you are running.
It is also not possible to create a virtual machine from the physical machine that you are using to do the migration, because the migration tool would be using the disk that it is copying.
Instead, you could provide a bootable image, or a bootable partition or disk that is currently not in use.
Tip
If you want to convert a Windows VM from a foreign hypervisor (not from QEMU/KVM with Q35/
virtio-scsi
),
you must install the
virtio-win
drivers to your Windows. Otherwise, your VM won’t boot.
Expand to see how to integrate the required drivers to your Windows VM
Install the required tools on the host:
Install
virt-v2v
version >= 2.3.4 (this is the minimal version that supports the
--block-driver
option).
Install the
virtio-win
package, or download the
virtio-win.iso
image and put it into the
/usr/share/virtio-win
folder.
You might also need to install
rhsrvany
.
Now you can use
virt-v2v
to convert images from a foreign hypervisor to
raw
images for Incus and include the required drivers:
```
# Example 1. Convert a vmdk disk image to a raw image suitable for incus-migrate
sudo virt-v2v --block-driver virtio-scsi -o local -of raw -os ./os -i vmx ./test-vm.vmx
# Example 2. Convert a QEMU/KVM qcow2 image and integrate virtio-scsi driver
sudo virt-v2v --block-driver virtio-scsi -o local -of raw -os ./os -if qcow2 -i disk test-vm-disk.qcow2

```
You can find the resulting image in the
os
directory and use it with
incus-migrate
on the next steps.
Complete the following steps to migrate an existing machine to an Incus instance:
Download the
bin.linux.incus-migrate
tool (
bin.linux.incus-migrate.aarch64
or
bin.linux.incus-migrate.x86_64
) from the
Assets
section of the latest
Incus release
.
Place the tool on the machine that you want to use to create the instance.
Make it executable (usually by running
chmod
u+x
bin.linux.incus-migrate
).
Make sure that the machine has
rsync
installed.
If it is missing, install it (for example, with
sudo
apt
install
rsync
).
Run the tool:
```
sudo ./bin.linux.incus-migrate

```
The tool then asks you to provide the information required for the migration.
Tip
As an alternative to running the tool interactively, you can provide the configuration as parameters to the command.
See
./bin.linux.incus-migrate
--help
for more information.
Specify the Incus server URL, either as an IP address or as a DNS name.
Note
The Incus server must be
exposed to the network
.
If you want to import to a local Incus server, you must still expose it to the network.
You can then specify
127.0.0.1
as the IP address to access the local server.
Check and confirm the certificate fingerprint.
Choose a method for authentication (see
Remote API authentication
).
For example, if you choose using a certificate token, log on to the Incus server and create a token for the machine on which you are running the migration tool with
incus
config
trust
add
.
Then use the generated token to authenticate the tool.
Choose whether to create a container or a virtual machine.
See
About containers and VMs
.
Specify a name for the instance that you are creating.
Provide the path to a root file system (for containers) or a bootable disk, partition or image file (for virtual machines).
For containers, optionally add additional file system mounts.
For virtual machines, specify whether secure boot is supported.
Optionally, configure the new instance.
You can do so by specifying
profiles
, directly setting
configuration options
or changing
storage
or
network
settings.
Alternatively, you can configure the new instance after the migration.
When you are done with the configuration, start the migration process.

When the migration is complete, check the new instance and update its configuration to the new environment.
Typically, you must update at least the storage configuration (
/etc/fstab
) and the network configuration.

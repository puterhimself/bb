OVN network
¶
OVN
is a software-defined networking system that supports virtual network abstraction.
You can use it to build your own private cloud.
See
www.ovn.org
for more information.
The
ovn
network type allows to create logical networks using the OVN
SDN
.
This kind of network can be useful for labs and multi-tenant environments where the same logical subnets are used in multiple discrete networks.
An Incus OVN network can be connected to an existing managed
Bridge network
or
Physical network
to gain access to the wider network.
By default, all connections from the OVN logical networks are NATed to an IP allocated from the uplink network.
See
How to set up OVN with Incus
for basic instructions for setting up an OVN network.
Note
Static DHCP assignments depend on the client using its MAC address as the DHCP identifier.
This method prevents conflicting leases when copying an instance, and thus makes statically assigned leases work properly.
Configuration options
¶
The following configuration key namespaces are currently supported for the
ovn
network type:
bridge
(L2 interface configuration)
dns
(DNS server and resolution configuration)
ipv4
(L3 IPv4 configuration)
ipv6
(L3 IPv6 configuration)
security
(network ACL configuration)
user
(free-form key/value for user metadata)
Note
Incus uses the
CIDR notation
where network subnet information is required, for example,
192.0.2.0/24
or
2001:db8::/32
. This does not apply to cases where a single address is required, for example, local/remote addresses of tunnels, NAT addresses or specific addresses to apply to an instance.

Note
The
bridge.external_interfaces
option supports an extended format allowing the creation of missing VLAN interfaces.
The extended format is
<interfaceName>/<parentInterfaceName>/<vlanId>
.
When the external interface is added to the list with the extended format, the system will automatically create the interface upon the network’s creation and subsequently delete it when the network is terminated. The system verifies that the
<interfaceName>
does not already exist. If the interface name is in use with a different parent or VLAN ID, or if the creation of the interface is unsuccessful, the system will revert with an error message.

How to configure network load balancers
¶
Note
Network load balancers are currently available for the
OVN network
.
Network load balancers are similar to forwards in that they allow specific ports on an external IP address to be forwarded to specific ports on internal IP addresses in the network that the load balancer belongs to. The difference between load balancers and forwards is that load balancers can be used to share ingress traffic between multiple internal backend addresses.
This feature can be useful if you have limited external IP addresses or want to share a single external address and ports over multiple instances.
A load balancer is made up of:
A single external listen IP address.
One or more named backends consisting of an internal IP and optional port ranges.
One or more listen port ranges that are configured to forward to one or more named backends.
Create a network load balancer
¶
Use the following command to create a network load balancer:
```
incus network load-balancer create <network_name> <listen_address> [configuration_options...]

```
Each load balancer is assigned to a network.
It requires a single external listen address (see
Requirements for listen addresses
for more information about which addresses can be load-balanced).
Load balancer properties
¶
Network load balancers have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
listen_address
string
yes
IP address to listen on
description
string
no
Description of the network load balancer
config
string set
no
Configuration options as key/value pairs (see below)
backends
backend list
no
List of
backend specifications
ports
port list
no
List of
port specifications
Configuration options
¶
The following configuration options are available for load balancers:
healthcheck
Whether to perform checks on the backends
Key:
healthcheck
Type:
bool
Default:
false
healthcheck.failure_count
Number of failed tests to consider the backend offline
Key:
healthcheck.failure_count
Type:
integer
Default:
3
healthcheck.interval
Interval in seconds between health checks
Key:
healthcheck.interval
Type:
integer
Default:
10
healthcheck.success_count
Number of successful tests to consider the backend online
Key:
healthcheck.success_count
Type:
integer
Default:
3
healthcheck.timeout
Test timeout
Key:
healthcheck.timeout
Type:
integer
Default:
30
user.*
Free form user key/value storage
Key:
user.*
Type:
string
User keys can be used in search.
Requirements for listen addresses
¶
The following requirements must be met for valid listen addresses:
Allowed listen addresses must be defined in the uplink network’s
ipv{n}.routes
settings or the project’s
restricted.networks.subnets
setting (if set).
The listen address must not overlap with a subnet that is in use with another network or entity in that network.
Configure backends
¶
You can add backend specifications to the network load balancer to define target addresses (and optionally ports).
The backend target address must be within the same subnet as the network that the load balancer is associated to.
Use the following command to add a backend specification:
```
incus network load-balancer backend add <network_name> <listen_address> <backend_name> <target_address> [<target_ports>]

```
The target ports are optional.
If not specified, the load balancer defaults to using the frontend port as the backend target port.
If you want to forward the traffic to different ports, you have two options:
Specify a single target port to forward traffic from all listen ports to this target port.
Specify a set of target ports with the same number of ports as the listen ports to forward traffic from the first listen port to the first target port, the second listen port to the second target port, and so on.
Backend properties
¶
Network load balancer backends have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
name
string
yes
Name of the backend
target_address
string
yes
IP address to forward to
target_port
string
no
Target port(s) (e.g.
70,80-90
or
90
), same as the
port
’s
listen_port
if empty
description
string
no
Description of backend
Configure ports
¶
You can add port specifications to the network load balancer to forward traffic from specific ports on the listen address to specific ports on one or more target backends.
Use the following command to add a port specification:
```
incus network load-balancer port add <network_name> <listen_address> <protocol> <listen_ports> <backend_name>[,<backend_name>...]

```
You can specify a single listen port or a set of ports.
The backend(s) specified must have target port(s) settings compatible with the port’s listen port(s) setting.
Port properties
¶
Network load balancer ports have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
protocol
string
yes
Protocol for the port(s) (
tcp
or
udp
)
listen_port
string
yes
Listen port(s) (e.g.
80,90-100
)
target_backend
backend list
yes
Backend name(s) to forward to
description
string
no
Description of port(s)
Edit a network load balancer
¶
Use the following command to edit a network load balancer:
```
incus network load-balancer edit <network_name> <listen_address>

```
This command opens the network load balancer in YAML format for editing.
You can edit both the general configuration, backend and the port specifications.
Delete a network load balancer
¶
Use the following command to delete a network load balancer:
```
incus network load-balancer delete <network_name> <listen_address>

```

Type:
unix-hotplug
¶
Note
The
unix-hotplug
device type is supported for containers.
It supports hotplugging.
Unix hotplug devices make the requested Unix device appear as a device in the instance (under
/dev
).
If the device exists on the host system, you can read from it and write to it.
The implementation depends on
systemd-udev
to be run on the host.

How to configure network ACLs
¶
Note
Network ACLs are available for the
OVN NIC type
, the
OVN network
and the
Bridge network
(with some exceptions, see
Bridge limitations
).
Network
ACLs
define traffic rules that allow controlling network access between different instances connected to the same network, and access to and from other networks.
Network ACLs can be assigned directly to the
NIC
of an instance or to a network.
When assigned to a network, the ACL applies to all NICs connected to the network.
The instance NICs that have a particular ACL applied (either explicitly or implicitly through a network) make up a logical group, which can be referenced from other rules as a source or destination.
See
ACL groups
for more information.
Create an ACL
¶
Use the following command to create an ACL:
```
incus network acl create <ACL_name> [configuration_options...]

```
This command creates an ACL without rules.
As a next step,
add rules
to the ACL.
Valid network ACL names must adhere to the following rules:
Names must be between 1 and 63 characters long.
Names must be made up exclusively of letters, numbers and dashes from the ASCII table.
Names must not start with a digit or a dash.
Names must not end with a dash.
ACL properties
¶
ACLs have the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
name
string
yes
Unique name of the network ACL in the project
description
string
no
Description of the network ACL
ingress
rule list
no
Ingress traffic rules
egress
rule list
no
Egress traffic rules
config
string set
no
Configuration options as key/value pairs (only
user.*
custom keys supported)
Add or remove rules
¶
Each ACL contains two lists of rules:
Ingress
rules apply to inbound traffic going towards the NIC.
Egress
rules apply to outbound traffic leaving the NIC.
To add a rule to an ACL, use the following command, where
<direction>
can be either
ingress
or
egress
:
```
incus network acl rule add <ACL_name> <direction> [properties...]

```
This command adds a rule to the list for the specified direction.
You cannot edit a rule (except if you
edit the full ACL
), but you can delete rules with the following command:
```
incus network acl rule remove <ACL_name> <direction> [properties...]

```
You must either specify all properties needed to uniquely identify a rule or add
--force
to the command to delete all matching rules.
Rule ordering and priorities
¶
Rules are provided as lists.
However, the order of the rules in the list is not important and does not affect
filtering.
Incus automatically orders the rules based on the
action
property as follows:
drop
reject
allow
Automatic default action for any unmatched traffic (defaults to
reject
, see
Configure default actions
).
This means that when you apply multiple ACLs to a NIC, there is no need to specify a combined rule ordering.
If one of the rules in the ACLs matches, the action for that rule is taken and no other rules are considered.
Rule properties
¶
ACL rules have the following properties:

allow
,
allow-stateless

State of the rule (
enabled
,
disabled
or
logged
), defaulting to
enabled
if not specified
description
string
no
Description of the rule
source
string
no
Comma-separated list of CIDR or IP ranges, source subject name selectors (for ingress rules), or empty for any
destination
string
no
Comma-separated list of CIDR or IP ranges, destination subject name selectors (for egress rules), or empty for any
protocol
string
no

) or empty for any
source_port
string
no
If protocol is
udp
or
tcp
, then a comma-separated list of ports or port ranges (start-end inclusive), or empty for any
destination_port
string
no
If protocol is
udp
or
tcp
, then a comma-separated list of ports or port ranges (start-end inclusive), or empty for any
icmp_type
string
no
If protocol is
icmp4
or
icmp6
, then ICMP type number, or empty for any
icmp_code
string
no
If protocol is
icmp4
or
icmp6
, then ICMP code number, or empty for any
Use selectors in rules
¶
Note
This feature is supported only for the
OVN NIC type
and the
OVN network
.
The
source
field (for ingress rules) and the
destination
field (for egress rules) support using selectors instead of CIDR or IP ranges.
With this method, you can use ACL groups or network selectors to define rules for groups of instances without needing to maintain IP lists or create additional subnets.
Use address sets in rules
¶
Note
This feature is supported only for the
bridge network using
nftables
and the
OVN network
.
The
source
field (for ingress rules) and the
destination
field (for egress rules) support using address sets.
With this feature you can create groups of addresses and / or networks to match rules against. You can eventually mix them with literals addresses and CIDR.
To use one in a rule:
```
source=\$<name>

```
ACL groups
¶
Instance NICs that are assigned a particular ACL (either explicitly or implicitly through a network) make up a logical port group.
Such ACL groups are called
subject name selectors
, and they can be referenced with the name of the ACL in other ACL groups.
For example, if you have an ACL with the name
foo
, you can specify the group of instance NICs that are assigned this ACL as source with
source=foo
.
Network selectors
¶
You can use
network subject selectors
to define rules based on the network that the traffic is coming from or going to.
There are two special network subject selectors called
@internal
and
@external
.
They represent network local and external traffic, respectively.
For example:
```
source=@internal

```
If your network supports
network peers
, you can reference traffic to or from the peer connection by using a network subject selector in the format
@<network_name>/<peer_name>
.
For example:
```
source=@ovn1/mypeer

```
When using a network subject selector, the network that has the ACL applied to it must have the specified peer connection.
Otherwise, the ACL cannot be applied to it.
Log traffic
¶
Generally, ACL rules are meant to control the network traffic between instances and networks.
However, you can also use them to log specific network traffic, which can be useful for monitoring, or to test rules before actually enabling them.
To add a rule for logging, create it with the
state=logged
property.
You can then display the log output for all logging rules in the ACL with the following command:
```
incus network acl show-log <ACL_name>

```
Edit an ACL
¶
Use the following command to edit an ACL:
```
incus network acl edit <ACL_name>

```
This command opens the ACL in YAML format for editing.
You can edit both the ACL configuration and the rules.
Assign an ACL
¶
After configuring an ACL, you must assign it to a network or an instance NIC.
To do so, add it to the
security.acls
list of the network or NIC configuration.
For networks, use the following command:
```
incus network set <network_name> security.acls="<ACL_name>"

```
For instance NICs, use the following command:
```
incus config device set <instance_name> <device_name> security.acls="<ACL_name>"

```
Configure default actions
¶
When one or more ACLs are applied to a NIC (either explicitly or implicitly through a network), a default reject rule is added to the NIC.
This rule rejects all traffic that doesn’t match any of the rules in the applied ACLs.
You can change this behavior with the network and NIC level
security.acls.default.ingress.action
and
security.acls.default.egress.action
settings.
The NIC level settings override the network level settings.
For example, to set the default action for inbound traffic to
allow
for all instances connected to a network, use the following command:
```
incus network set <network_name> security.acls.default.ingress.action=allow

```
To configure the same default action for an instance NIC, use the following command:
```
incus config device set <instance_name> <device_name> security.acls.default.ingress.action=allow

```
Bridge limitations
¶
When using network ACLs with a bridge network, be aware of the following limitations:
Unlike OVN ACLs, bridge ACLs are applied only on the boundary between the bridge and the Incus host.
This means they can only be used to apply network policies for traffic going to or from external networks.
They cannot be used for to create
intra-bridge
firewalls, thus firewalls that control traffic between instances connected to the same bridge, except when ACLs are applied directly to the NIC device. In that case the
reject
ACL rules applied to the ingress traffic are converted to
drop
to address
nftables
limitation.
ACL groups and network selectors
are not supported.
Baseline network service rules are added before ACL rules (in their respective INPUT/OUTPUT chains), because we cannot differentiate between INPUT/OUTPUT and FORWARD traffic once we have jumped into the ACL chain.
Because of this, ACL rules cannot be used to block baseline service rules.

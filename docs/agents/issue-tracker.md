# Issue Tracker: GitHub + Local Markdown (Hybrid)

Issues and specs for this repo are tracked in **both** GitHub Issues and local markdown files in `.scratch/`. Use whichever surface the context calls for.

## When to use which

- **GitHub Issues** — shared, visible, collaborative work. Anything another contributor or CI pipeline might need to see.
- **Local markdown (`.scratch/`)** — solo work, scratch specs, rapid prototyping, and anything that lives close to the code before it's ready for GitHub.

## GitHub conventions

Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations.

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

### Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Local markdown conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` — never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Default to **local markdown** for solo/scratch work (create a file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`). Use **GitHub Issues** for anything that needs visibility, collaboration, or CI integration. Ask the user only when genuinely ambiguous.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

If a number is given (`#42`), use `gh issue view <number> --comments`. If a path or slug is given, read the local markdown file at that path.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single tracking artifact with **child** items as tickets. Use GitHub for shared efforts; local markdown for solo efforts.

### GitHub wayfinding

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies** — the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only — the live gate). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.

### Local markdown wayfinding

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
